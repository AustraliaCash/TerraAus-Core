AUS-Cash Core Wallet

####	About

>		Australiacash is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
>		completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
>		parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
>		with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.
>
>		Australia Cash is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software project released 
>		under the MIT/X11 license. Creation and transfer of coins is based on an open source 
>		cryptographic protocol and is not managed by any central authority.


>		Australiacash Core is the original Australiacash client and it builds the backbone of the network.
>		However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Australiacash transactions
>		depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
>		process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
